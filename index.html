    <question class="question">
      1.2-1 Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic
      content at the applica- tion level, and discuss the
      function of the algorithms involved.
    </question>

    <answer>
      In Uber, to find the car which will arrive to the person in the shortest time.
    </answer>

    <question>
      1.2-2 Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion
      sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size n,
      insertion sort runs in \(8n^2\) steps, while merge sort runs
      in \(64n\lg{n}\) steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?
    </question>

    <answer>
      $$ 8n^2 < 64n\lg{n}, n \in \mathbb{N} $$
      $$ n < 8\lg{n} $$
      $$ n < \lg{n^8} $$
      $$ 2^n < n^8 $$
    </answer>

8n^2 < 64n * log n

1.2-3 What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2n on the same machine?
    When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
    $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
